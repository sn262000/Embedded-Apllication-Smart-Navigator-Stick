# Embedded-Apllication-Smart-Navigator-Stick
An embedded application which assists visually impaired people to identify obstacles in the range of 4 meters which include stones ,water puddles,solid objectsetc.
The smart stick designed will emerge as a proposed solution to enable
visually impaired to identify the world around. In this, we have designed a
smart stick incorporated with the ultrasonic sensors to detect any other
obstacles in front of the user, within desired range. Buzzer sound and the
vibration motor are activated when any obstacle is detected. This system
uses the Arduino UNO, vibration motor and buzzer. The stick is capable of
detecting all obstacles including water puddles and gives a warning through
buzzer thereby making their travel safe. The smart stick designed is
incorporated with water sensor to detect any water pits, water source or
puddles and gives warning through buzzer. The buzzer signals are designed
in such a way that the user can differentiate between the sounds to identify
whether there is an object or watersource before him/her. The stick made is
light-weight,eco-friendly and easy to carry.
